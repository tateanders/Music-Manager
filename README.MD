# Music Manager

Music Manager is a lightweight, interactive MP3 file manager with a GUI frontend built using **Raylib** and **Clay UI**.  

It is designed to help DJs organize their music collection efficiently and prepare their files for **Serato** smart crates and **Rekordbox** intelligent playlists.  

This has only been tested on an ARM mac but should in theory work on Linux as well (let me know).

#### **Note: this program edits the metadata of ID3v2.3 and ID3v2.4 mp3 files and will overwrite any current comments in your mp3 files.**

## Features

- **Scan and display MP3 files**  
  Opens a directory called `mp3` (can be changed in the code) on the user's desktop, scans for all MP3 files contained within, and displays them in an interactive frontend.

- **Add Tags**  
  A button labeled **"Add Tags"** automatically adds a comment to each MP3 file containing the file path relative to the root `mp3` directory.  
  This is compatible with Serato smart crates for automatic sorting.

- **Find Duplicates**  
  A button labeled **"Find Dups"** uses djb2 hashing to find all duplicate songs and their locations in the root `mp3` directory.  

- **Planned Features**  
  - Edit metadata such as **title** and **artist**.
  - Remove metadata added by Serato to prepare files for re-analysis.
  - Support for mutiple alphabets.
  - Some way to mark remixes of songs.

- **Issues**  
  - Could be more performant.
  - Wierd bugs where strings act very wrong randomly.
  - Needs to use more const variables.
  - Would like to have getters and setters for all structs.
  - Want to move all button interaction into a function and have on hover interaction.
